Three components to the project: Firmware, Software (App), Backend (AWS cloud)

Firmware: Specifically programmed for the ESP8266 Wifi microcontroller using Arduino 

Software: Leverages React-Native to support on both Android and IOS

Backend: Uses the AWS platform as a broker(manager) between App and MCU. Specifically uses AWS IOT that uses the MQTT protocol for M2M communication.
